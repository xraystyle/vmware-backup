This is a short script that can be used for automated backup of VMWare virtual machines
without having to shut them down or quit VMWare first.

Tested on OS X 10.6 - 10.8, in Ruby 1.8.7 and 2.0.0

I don't see why this wouldn't work on other platforms as long as there's no major
syntax changes for the vmrun command on other platforms or anything.

Usage:

Scroll through the script and edit the paths and variables as appropriate.
Things that need to be changed are between angle brackets, e.g. <change this>.

Once the appropriate edits have been made to the script for your system you can run 
the script manually or automate a recurring run with the tool of your choice.

Included here is an example launchd XML .plist to run the script every night at 10 PM on OS X. 
See the launchd documentation for details on what you can do with launchd, it's a good 
bit more flexible than cron.

The .plist should go into "/Library/LaunchDaemons". Make sure the script is 775.
